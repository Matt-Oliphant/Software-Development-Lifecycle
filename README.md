# Software-Development-Lifecycle

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?**

* User needs vary on each project so communication is essential to understand what the user needs are. In this project, SNHU Travel needed a GUI that displayed the top-5 resort destinations. The user communicated specific needs during several meetings and once communicated, I implemented them into the program by carefully listening, organizing, and executing. Creating user stories helps lead to the final product by providing the format to break the product down into manageable pieces and once small and certain enough, the user stories were organized into the product backlog. From there the user stories were developed to meet the definition of done, until the sprint was completed and the final product delivered.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

* I approach developing programs from a holistic view with plenty of planning and forethought. In a real-world situation, the approach would be developed as outlined in the PowerPoint presentation. I hope to incorporate the evolution of self-organization and cross-functionality into my future development work. I hope to specialize in developing solid code, but also plan to be well-rounded by understanding rigorous testing standards and considering other aspects of SDLC through the lens of other team roles.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

* Being a good team member means remaining open to change and taking responsibility for the product as a whole, rather than just the part that they worked on. It's important to be open-minded and only provide constructive feedback. Avoid exacerbating difficult situations and focus on solutions instead. It's okay to reach out to a support network because help is needed, but a bad team member will not do this. A good team member has a mindset focused on self-improvement and desires to share that improvement with the rest of their team.
